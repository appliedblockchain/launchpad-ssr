### Guidelines:

To get data from the backend you will need to call the backend api. To call the api please use `getServerSideProps()`

Example: https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering


---

For forms, get / post requests take inspiration from this basic example: https://github.com/pallavkothari/nextjs-forms/blob/master/components/MyForm.js (except you can use async/await :))


### Run

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
g
